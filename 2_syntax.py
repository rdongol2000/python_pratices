# Identifiers
# Any user defined names in the program are called identifiers
# Exmpales: module name, function name, class name, variable name

# Rules of naming an identifier
# 1. Identifiers are case-sensitive. Uppercase and lowercase and lowercase matter.
A = 5
a = 3
print(a)
print(A)
abc = 2
Abc = 5


# 2. Identifiers can't be a keyword
# There are 35 keywords in python and they cant be used as an idrntifier
# def = 5 # invlaid beacuse def is a keyword
# help ("keywords") displays all the python keywords

# help ("keywords") displays all the python keywords


# 3.Identifiers can't contain special symbols like @, #, $ etc.
# a@ = 3 # Invalid

# 4. Identifiers can contain digits but it should not start with a digit
a1 =12 # Valid
# 1a = 4 # Invalid

# 5. Identifiers can contain underscore (_) and can also start with an undersocre 
a_ = 12 
a_b = 12 
_a = 12
_ = 12
__ = 1

# 5. Identifiers can contain underscore (_) and can also start with an underscore 
a_ = 12
a_b = 12
_a = 12
_ = 12
__ = 1

# Syntax in Python 
# Identation is a big issue in python to represent a block of code

a  = 5
if a == 5:
    print("the number is 5")
print(a)

a = 1; b = 2

message = "Hello World." \
            "I am learning Python"


a = 1
print(a) # 1
