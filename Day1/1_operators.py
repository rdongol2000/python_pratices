# Operator are the special symbols which are used or carry out arithmetical and logical operations.
# Like in any other language python also has it's set of operators

# Arithmetic Operators
# Logical Operators
# Relational Operators
# Assignment Operators
# Membership Operators 
# Identity Operators


# Arithmetic Operators (+, -, /, *, **, %)
a = 1 # Python statement
b = 2 # Python statement

result = a+b 
print ("The result of the sum is", result)

result = b ** 2
print(result) # 4

result = 5 % 2
print (result) # 1

result = 5 / 2
print(result) # 2.5


# Relational / Comparison Opertors (>, <, >=, <=, ==,!=)
# The result of comparison operations are either True or False

a = 20
b = 15 

print (a > b) # True
print (a < b) # False
print (a == b) # False
print ( a >= b) # True
print (a <= b) # False
print (a !=b) # True


# Logical Operators (and, or, not)
# The result of logical operations are either True or False

print (True and True) # True
print (True and False) # False
print (False and True) # False
print (False and False) # False 

print(True or True) # True
print (True or False) # True
print(False or True) # True
print(False or False) # False
# 2nd part
print (not True) # False
print (not False) # True
