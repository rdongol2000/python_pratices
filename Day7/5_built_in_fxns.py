# sum()
# It is a built-in function which takes iterable of numbers as an input

r = sum ([1, 2, 2])# 
print(r) # 6

r = sum ((1, 2, 3)) # 
print(r) # 6

r = sum ([1, 2, 3])
print(r) # 6

# max()
# It also takes iterable as an input and returns the maximum from that iterable 

print(max(4, 5, 1, 8, 10 )) # 10

# min()
# It also takes iterable as an input and returns the minimum from that iterable
print(min(4, 5, 1, 8, 10)) #1


# sorted()
# It also takes iterable and returns that sorted data

data = sorted([7, 1, 3, 2, 10, 15])
print(list(data))


data = sorted([7, 1, 3, 2, 10, 15])
print(list(data))


data = sorted ([7, 1, 3, 2, 10, 15], reverse=True)
print(list(data)) # [15, 10, 7, 3, 2, 1]


# reversed()
# It also takes iterable and returns the reversed data

data = reversed([7, 1, 3, 2, 10, 15])
print(list(data)) # [15, 10, 2, 3, 1, 7]
